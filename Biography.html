                <h2>Overall</h2>
                <p class="lead">Formed in Sheffield, 2004, Bring Me The Horizon was a deathcore band consisting
                    of four members, lead singer Oli Sykes, drummer Matt Nicholls, guitarist Lee Malia, bassist Matt
                    Kean.
                    <br><br>
                    Their debut EP, "This Is What the Edge of Your Seat Was Made For" didnt see much success, unlike
                    their
                    later albums.
                    As their career went on they went through a lot of changes, the most noticeable being from their 2nd
                    and
                    3rd album, feeling lighter and more produced. Throughout they years they went from deathcore/screamo
                    to metalcore, to hard-rock, to pop, to metalcore again. Jordan Fish was the reason for improvement
                    in
                    production over the years.<br><br> BMTH was influenced by At The Gates, Carcass, Pantera, Metallica,
                    Zao, Arch
                    Enemy, The Dilinger Escape Plan, Everytime I Die, Norma Jean, Skycamefalling and Poison The Well.
                    Later influences were Twenty One Pilots, Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory, Killswitch Engage's Alive or
                    Just
                    Breathing, Panic! At The Disco, Radiohead and many more.

                <h2>Oli Sykes</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    In His early life he moved to Australia as an infant for about 6 years. During his highschool years
                    he released short tracks under the name Quakebeat.
                    He also played in the hip-hop band "Womb 2 Da Tomb" with his brother and another soon-to-be BMTH
                    member. Later he played in "Purple Curto" under the name Olisaurus, that later became his solo
                    project's name. In 2004 he formed Bring Me The Horizon.<br><br> He also features in many songs, like
                    "Even
                    If
                    You Win, You're Still a Rat", "Admiral's Arms" by Architects, "Silence Speaks" with While She
                    Sleeps, "Code Mistake" with CORPSE or "Bad Life" with Sigrid. He performed with Linkin Park in 2017.
                    In 2014 he got addicted to ketamine losing a lot of
                    his voice, and singing way more than screaming. He got his voice back by now, but its still scary
                    how it could've been the end of the band. He is married to Alissa Salls, featuring in some songs of
                    BMTH like Parasite Eve.
                    Medicine is a song about their relationship.
